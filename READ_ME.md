![Background Edit Screenshot 1](README_docs/Edit.png)

## Code describe
* Storing the food information at home.js.
* When the user clicks on adding or minus button, it will check the list and put the item into the list or move them out of the list.
* On the homepage, make sure the user could access different cake recipes, by clicking on the picture of the cake. The pictures were linked to the details.js and it will judge the item that the user clicks on to link to each details page.

## Iteration
### The position of the shopping bag icon
* In the final mockup, the "bag icon" position on the homepage changes from the right corner to the left top of the navigation bar.
![Position Of Bag Icon](README_docs/Homepage.png)

## Future possible improvements
### The homepage sliding picture
* The biggest picture could be sliding automatically showing more pictures of the cake.
![Homepage](README_docs/Homepage.png)
### The Background
* The background could be using P5.js to make the icons move randomly and linked to letting it be the website background.
### Link the list page item to the details page
* When staying on the list page, it could also access the details page by clicking on the item.
